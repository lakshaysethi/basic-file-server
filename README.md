# basic-file-server

Well I ran into this problem :

I spun up a windows VM and used a windows only software which output a file that I want to bring download/ take out of the VM 

so what we can do is that turn on this server and access it via the web browser inside the vm and upload files from the Vm into this server via the web ui

then we can download the file from the server into any device 

there is no security at the moment - so use in a protected network
